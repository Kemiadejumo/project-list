    "#### Cervical cancer is a form of cancer that affects the cervix’s cells. The cervix can be found in the lower region of the uterus which connects to the vagina. Cervical cancer can only occur in women. Multiple factors can contribute to the development of cervical cancer. Major factors that play a major role or increases the chance of developing cervical cancer is HPV,  other cancer, CIN, and Age. HPV also known as Human papillomavirus, is a commonvirus that can cause cancer. Women who are diagnosed with HPV have a very high chance of developing cervical cancer because of the damage done to the Immune system by the HPV.Women can reduce the risk of cervical cancer by getting the HPV vaccine. In this project, I will be working with patients' medical records that comprises possible risk factors (features) and diagnosis(response).\n",
    "#### The primary goal of this assignment is to highlight the role of data science in healthcare. The use of data science in medicine can be very beneficial. Medical diagnostics with data science are becoming more and more efficient and accessible to patients and doctors. There are other benefits of data science in healthcare such as drug discovery, biosymetrics, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### For my project, I will be focusing on medical diagnosis by using past medical history data to predict diagnosis and risk probability. With machine learning tools, we can predict illness and treatments that will help physicians intervene earlier. In this project, although studies in the past indicate that HPV significantly increases the chance of cervical cancer. We can use machine learning to determine other high-risk factors of cervical cancer. The secondary goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of patient Electronic medical records and history, to determine the risk factors that contribute to cervical cancer. And, to determine the best machine learning algorithm model for future prediction. This dataset for this project comprises 858 patients records with 36 possibly contributing factors of cervical cancer. I will analyze this data and determine the high determining factors. Note, that is just only based on a statistical analysis of the dataset.\n",
    "#### I hypothesize that high-risk factors(features) are going to be the previous diagnosis of HPV, cancer, CIN, Age, Number of sexual partners.  Through the statistical correlation and finding the feature of importance from my model, I will determine the high-risk factors.\n",
    "#### Then, I will build three machine learning algorithms; Logistic regression, Random Forest Classification, and DecisionTree Classification, then compare results. Using the precision,recall, and accuracy score, I will determine the best machine learning algorithm for predicting future datasets. Again, I am hypothesizing that the Random Forest classification algorithm would be the best model for future prediction and will be used to determine the important features. As an individual who currently works in the healthcare field, one of my objectives is to improve the healthcare system. By working alongside physicians, I want to employ tools like machine learning to help them make quicker and more accurate diagnoses. Not only does it benefit the physician making diagnosis easier and quicker but also for the patients. Patients can get accurate diagnoses quicker or early interventions and begin treatments sooner.\n"
